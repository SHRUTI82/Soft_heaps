# Soft_heaps
It is a priority queue data structure where nodes are the collection of binary trees.
It is the direct implementation of Chazelle's heap in which binary trees are used instead of binomial trees.
# Here 4 operations are performed-
1. Insert    : Function to enter the ckeys and keys.
2. Min_key   : Function that find minimum ckey
3. Delete    : Function that deletes the data of the linked list.
4. Traversal : Function that print the stored data structure.
